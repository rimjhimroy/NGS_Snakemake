BFC is a standalone high-performance tool for correcting sequencing errors from
Illumina sequencing data. It is specifically designed for high-coverage
whole-genome human data, though also performs well for small genomes.

The BFC algorithm is a variant of the classical spectrum alignment algorithm
introduced by [Pevzner et al (2001)][Euler]. It uses an exhaustive search to
find a k-mer path through a read that minimizes a heuristic objective function
jointly considering penalties on correction, quality and k-mer support. This
algorithm was first implemented in my fermi assembler and then refined a few
times in fermi, fermi2 and now in BFC. In the k-mer counting phase, BFC uses a
blocked bloom filter to filter out most singleton k-mers and keeps the rest in a
hash table ([Melsted and Pritchard, 2011][bfcounter]). The use of bloom filter
is how BFC is named, though other correctors such as [Lighter][lighter] and
[Bless][bless] actually rely more on bloom filter than BFC.

Usage: bfc [options] <to-count.fq> [to-correct.fq]
Options:
  -s FLOAT     approx genome size (k/m/g allowed; change -k and -b) [unset]
  -k INT       k-mer length [33]
  -t INT       number of threads [1]
  -b INT       set Bloom filter size to pow(2,INT) bits [33]
  -H INT       use INT hash functions for Bloom filter [4]
  -d FILE      dump hash table to FILE [null]
  -E           skip error correction
  -R           refine bfc-corrected reads
  -r FILE      restore hash table from FILE [null]
  -w INT       no more than 5 ec or 2 highQ ec in INT-bp window [10]
  -c INT       min k-mer coverage [3]
  -Q           force FASTA output
  -1           drop reads containing unique k-mers
  -v           show version number
  -h           show command line help

Flow:
- Concatenate all reads (so we use all information for correction)
- Correct all reads using that larger set, not removing reads with unique k-mers

(later we can decide to remove reads, but then we would have to check for broken pairs)

Expects a global variable CONFIG (e.g. parsed from json) of at least the following structure:
{
    "bfc":{
        "kmer_length": 55,
        "genome_size": "1g",
        "optionalOpts": ""
    }

}
